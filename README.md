# Self-Hosted Setup 

This is where I save my configs for my self-hosted services.  I try to select
mostly lightweight and minimal services but it's not allways easy to find!

Currently there is :

- [FileBrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) provides a file managing interface within a specified directory 
- [gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic), a FLOSS music server compatible 
with the subsonic API
- [airsonic-refix](https://github.com/tamland/airsonic-refix) a subsonic web
client

TODO:
- something for photos
- something to get data from gdrive
