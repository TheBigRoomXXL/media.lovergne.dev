# Self-Hosted Setup 

This is where I save my configs for my self-hosted services.  I try to select
mostly lightweight and minimal services but it's not allways easy to find!

Currently there is :

- [Caddy]: Awesome proxy with automatic HTTPS
- [FileBrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser): Provides a web based filebrowser
- [gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic): FLOSS music server compatible with the subsonic API
- [airsonic-refix](https://github.com/tamland/airsonic-refix) Subsonic web client. 
- [glance](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance):  Highly customisable feed agitator.
- [it-tools](https://github.com/CorentinTh/it-tools): Collection of handy online tools for developers.
- 

TODO:
- something for photos
- proxy based auth
- password manager (maybe)
